*for an efficient code we must use the correct data type for each variable
*using a wrong data type means an inefficient code, and may lead to fatal mistakes

In C there are 4 Types of Data:
1)Basic Types:integer types,floating point types(arithmetic types)
2)enumerated types(arithmetic types, they are used to define variables that can onlyassign a certain,dicrete
integer values throughout the program).
3)user defined types(Pointer types,structure types,function types,array types,union types)
4)void types

*to choose a data type we must ask two questions:
a) what is the type of data (numeric(+ or -),alphabetic)?
this is to choose the correct data type(preventing errors)
b)what is the size of data(min,max)?
this is to choose the correct size of the datatype(for efficiency and preventing overflows)

*each data type has its size of storage in memory, and each byte in memory has its unique address.
*in memory values are stored in binary for, only zeros and ones exist in memory.
*number of values that can be carried by a data type=2^(number of bits)
*we use unsigned keyword if we are certain that the data will be +ve numbers only
*we use signed keyword if the data maybe +ve or -ve.
*it is the best practice to always write signed or unsigned before the data type, because it differs from
a compiler to the other whether the data type is signed or unsigned by default.

*Size of Data types:
char : 1 byte                unsigned range:0 to 2^(1*8) -1 , signed range:-2^(1*7) to 2^(1*7) -1
short: 2 byte
long : 4 byte
long long: 8 byte

* the best practice is to have full control be determining signed or unsigned, and setting size by(char,short,long,long long)

sizeof(); the sizeof() operator takes any variable or datatype and returns its size in  bytes


Format specifiers: 
sepecifier              data type               description
%i or %d :              int                     for signed integers
%f:                     float or double         
%c:                     char                    for a single character
%s:                     char*(string)           a sequence of characters ending with a null character \0
%u:                     unsigned int 
%p:                     pointer                 prints a memory address in hexadecimal
%x:                     int                     hexadecimal base
%o:                     int                     octal base

Format Modifiers (Width & Precision)
You can place modifiers between the % and the type character to control the appearance of the output.

A. Precision
Used after a decimal point (.), it controls the number of decimal places for floating-point numbers or the maximum number of characters for a string.
ex:
%.2f	Display a float with two digits after the decimal point.	10.50
%.5s	Display only the first five characters of a string.	Hello (from "Hello World")

B. Field Width:
A number placed before the decimal point sets the minimum field width,The output is padded with spaces if the value is shorter than the width
ex:
%10d	Display an integer in a field of 10 characters, right-justified.	42
%-10sDisplay a string in a field of 10 characters, left-justified (using the minus flag).Name      


variables definition and declaration:
syntax: datatype variable_name;

Declaration vs. Definition
This is a critical distinction in C programming, especially when dealing with global variables and the extern keyword.

1. Variable Declaration
A declaration simply introduces a variable's name and its type to the compiler. 
It's a promise that the variable exists somewhere.
Goal: Inform the compiler about the variable's existence so it can perform type checking.
Memory: Does not allocate memory (no storage is set aside).
Keywords: Often uses the extern keyword.
Examples of Declaration:

extern int total;

void func(int a); (Function declaration/prototype)

2. Variable Definition
A definition is where a variable is actually created. It tells the compiler to allocate the required amount of memory for that variable.
Goal: Instruct the compiler to reserve and label a piece of memory.
Memory: Allocates memory for the variable.
Keywords: Usually no storage class specifier is needed, but providing an initial value always makes it a definition.
Examples of Definition:
int total; (Default initialization to 0 for global variables)
int count = 5;
void func(int a) { /* body */ } (Function definition)

the extern keyword:
The extern keyword is a storage class specifier used to declare a variable or function that is defined in another file (or another part of the current file).
What it does: It tells the compiler, "The actual memory for this variable has been allocated elsewhere. Don't worry about allocating memory here; just remember its name and type so I can use it.
"Purpose: It allows you to share global variables between different source files in a multi-file C project without causing multiple definition errors during the linking stage.
