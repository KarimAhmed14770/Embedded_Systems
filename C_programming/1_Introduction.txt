Programming languages are classified into three categories:
1.Low-level language(very close to Hardware)
2.Mid-level language
3.High level Language

*Machine language is zeros and ones(01)
*Assembly instructions differs for each processor
*High level code------->Compilation----------->low level code
*Assembler Tool takes assembly code and converts it into machine language
*C is the most efficient high level language it is very close to the hardware,being close to the hardware improves performance.
*For critical Applications: Write Assembly code, main code can be (C+Assembly)
*Best way to use C, is using a text editor+ a compiler and not an ide.
*The three stages of creating aprogram:
1.Write a program
2.Compile the program(Converts High level code into Machine language)
3.Run the program
