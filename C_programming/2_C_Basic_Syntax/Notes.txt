Tokens:
*A c program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal or a symbol.
*the compiler divides each line of code into tokens in a process called tokenization, when the compiler finds that there is a missing bracket or a semicolon it will give you a syntax error.
example: printf("Hello, World!\n"); consists of 5 Tokens
1)Printf
2) (
3) "Hello, World!\n"
4) )
5) ;

*any statement in C,Cpp must end with a semicolon.
*compiler ignores comments: 1) single line comment //, 2)block comment /**/.
* it is best practice to always use block comments /**/

Identifiers:
*A c identifier, is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined term
*identifier naming:
1)starts with A-Z,a-z or _ 
2)numbers and letters are available
3)the only special symbol available is _
4)C is case sensitive
int num=5; num is an identifier
printf("a"); printf is an identifier

Identifier Naming conventions:
a)Firstletters are Capital.                               StudentName
b)First letters are capital + underscores.	   Student_Name
c)First letters are small + underscores.	   student_name
*always make identifiers descriptive, and it is not recomended to make a long identifier

*How to know which functions are inside a library? open the .h file you will find all the functions prototypes in that library, the compiler knows how to get their definition from the definition file.

Keywords:
 a group of words that are reserved for the programming language and do a certain function, a user can't use these keywords for any other purpose like identifier names.

Whitespaces in C:
Whitespaces are ignored in C, but some whitespaces are important.
*a line containing whitespace is known as a blank line and it is totally ignored by c.
*int age; there must be at least one line space between int and age, for the copiler to be able to distinguish between them.
